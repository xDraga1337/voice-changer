## Voice changer web application that uses the Tone.js library for sound manipulation.

The app allows users to modify live microphone input with effects like pitch shift, volume control, reverb (including decay, pre-delay, and wetness), and an optional echo effect. Users can adjust these settings in real time through sliders and toggle the effects with checkboxes. The app displays a volume meter to monitor the microphone's audio level.

### Features
- Real-time voice effects (pitch shift, reverb, etc.)
- User-controlled sliders for detailed adjustments
- Interactive volume meter for visual feedback
- Simple start/stop functionality


To run it in other applications such as discord, video games VOIP chat etc.. you need to setup a local live server and [virtual cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) installed.
Tone.js audio processing requires a browser with JavaScript support.
